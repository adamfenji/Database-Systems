## üìò Project Overview

This repository showcases my work from **CS3425: Introduction to Database Systems**, a hands-on course at **Michigan Technological University** taught by **Professor Ruihong Zhang** in Fall 2023. The course focused on **designing, querying, securing, and building full-stack database applications** using SQL, Java (JDBC), PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and SQLite. The labs progressively built up to a complete multi-tiered banking system using MySQL, PHP, and SQLite, with client-side scripting and secure database interaction.

The class followed the textbook **_A First Course in Database Systems_ (3rd Edition) by Jeffrey D. Ullman and Jennifer Widom. We explored topics ranging from ER modeling and relational algebra to advanced SQL, web database integration, and database security.**

## üßë‚Äçüíª Final Project

The final course project, **DB-GroceryShop**, is a complete web application simulating a grocery store with customer login, product browsing, shopping cart, and database-driven order processing.

## üß™ Labs & Projects

| # | Title | Description |
|--|----------------------------|-------------|
| 0 | [ER Diagram & Relational Model](Lab_ER.pdf) | Designed an Entity-Relationship diagram and converted it to a relational schema |
| 1 | [Basic SQL & Schema Design](Lab1_basicSQL.pdf) | Wrote SQL to define schemas, run basic queries, and perform aggregation, filtering, and joins |
| 2 | [PSM & Triggers](Lab2_PSM.pdf) | Practiced Persistent Stored Modules (PSM) and triggers to automate behavior in MySQL |
| 3 | [Java + JDBC](Lab3_JDBC.pdf) | Built a Java application using JDBC to connect to and query a MySQL database |
| 4 | [HTML + PHP Integration](Lab4_html_php.pdf) | Created a front-end form to send data to PHP and interact with the MySQL backend |
| 5 | [PHP + PDO Banking App](Lab5_PHP_PDO.pdf) | Developed a modular online banking system with authentication, balance checks, and transfers using PDO and SQL transactions |
| 6 | [JavaScript + SQLite](Lab6_JS_SQLite.pdf) | Built a form interface with JavaScript and connected it to a local SQLite database for persistent storage |
